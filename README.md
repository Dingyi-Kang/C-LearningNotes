for (const uint32_t &id : *prev_level) { ... }: This is a range-based for loop in C++. It iterates through all the elements in prev_level. Each element is a uint32_t (an unsigned 32-bit integer), which is a typical representation for node identifiers in graph structures. The & indicates that id is a reference to the elements in prev_level, which means no copying of elements is done, enhancing performance.


if (node_set.find(id) != node_set.end()) { continue; }: This statement checks if the current node identifier (id) is already present in node_set, which is likely a set of nodes that have already been processed or visited.
node_set.find(id): This function call searches for id in node_set.
node_set.end(): This represents an iterator to the end of node_set, which in C++ standard library containers is a position just past the last element.
If id is found in node_set, the find method will not return node_set.end(), indicating the node is already processed. In that case, continue is executed, which skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next id.

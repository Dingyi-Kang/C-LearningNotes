for (const uint32_t &id : *prev_level) { ... }: This is a range-based for loop in C++. It iterates through all the elements in prev_level. Each element is a uint32_t (an unsigned 32-bit integer), which is a typical representation for node identifiers in graph structures. The & indicates that id is a reference to the elements in prev_level, which means no copying of elements is done, enhancing performance.
